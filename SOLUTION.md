# Solution Steps

1. Add PRIMARY KEY constraints to customers, accounts, and transactions tables to ensure each record is uniquely identifiable.

2. Apply NOT NULL constraints to critical identifier and data columns (like id, email, balance, etc.) to prevent incomplete records.

3. Add UNIQUE constraints on customer emails and account numbers (if present) to avoid duplicate identities/accounts.

4. Add relevant CHECK constraints to enforce business rules (e.g., balances are non-negative, transaction amounts are nonzero, transaction type is valid).

5. Establish foreign key constraints for referential integrity: accounts.customer_id should reference customers.id, and transactions.account_id should reference accounts.id.

6. Create indexes on accounts(customer_id) and transactions(account_id), as well as on transactions(created_at), to optimize common join/filter operations and reporting queries.

7. Write SQL queries to (1) fetch all transactions for a customer, (2) list all account balances, and (3) find accounts with unusually high transaction volumes.

8. Test the schema constraints and queries to ensure correctness and performance.
